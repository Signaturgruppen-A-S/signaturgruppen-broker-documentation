# MitID Flexibility app
MitID Flexibity app is the possibility to utilize the MitID app as the only authenticator for flows where a standard browser is not available. 
The usecases includes applications on smart-TVs, over-the-phone support and help-desk scenarios, legacy hardware terminals etc. In these cases, a normal, secure and up-to-date browser is not available, but a valid usecase for MitID is found. 

Contact Signaturgruppen for more information.

> Note: It is not a variant of MitID that is generally available and it has to be accepted and certified for each usecase.
